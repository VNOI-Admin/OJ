# VNOJ: VNOI Online Judge [![Build Status](https://github.com/VNOI-Admin/OJ/workflows/build/badge.svg)](https://github.com/VNOI-Admin/OJ/actions/) [![AGPL License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-AGPLv3.0-blue.svg)](http://www.gnu.org/licenses/agpl-3.0) [![Discord link](https://img.shields.io/discord/660930260405190688?color=%237289DA&label=Discord&logo=Discord)](https://discord.com/invite/TDyYVyd)

As a fork of [DMOJ](https://github.com/DMOJ/online-judge), VNOJ serves as [VNOI](https://vnoi.info/)'s official online judge and hosts its programming contests.

See it live at [oj.vnoi.info](https://oj.vnoi.info/)!

## Features

Check out its features [here](https://github.com/DMOJ/online-judge#features).

Additional features:

- Aside from Python checkers [here](https://docs.dmoj.ca/#/problem_format/custom_checkers), we can also write a custom C++ checker using `testlib.h`.

## Installation

Refer to the install documentation at [docs.dmoj.ca](https://docs.dmoj.ca/#/site/installation). Almost all installation steps remain the same as the docs, but there are several minor differences, including cloning this repo instead of DMOJ's repo.

### Additional step in installation:

- You needn't run `npm install *package_name*` commands mentioned in the page. They should be replaced with one `npm install` before you begin setting up the project. 

- You **have to** define `DMOJ_PROBLEM_DATA_ROOT` in `local_settings.py`, which should be the path to the directory that contains your problems' tests.

- Regarding disabling full-text search, please read [this issue](https://github.com/VNOI-Admin/OJ/issues/4) for more information.

- To sync the judge server and the site's cache, change the cache framework (`CACHES`) to `memcached` or `redis` instead of the default (local-memory caching).

- The home button in the admin dashboard (/admin) will redirect to `localhost:8081` if you use `python3 manage.py loaddata demo`, there are 2 ways to change that:

  1. You can change that in [demo.json](/judge/fixtures/demo.json)
  2. You can go to the admin page, scroll down to find the `Sites` setting and change `localhost:8081` to your domain.

- To support `testlib.h`, you need to copy [testlib.h](https://github.com/MikeMirzayanov/testlib/blob/master/testlib.h) to `g++`'s include path in the judge server. To speed up compile time, you can also create a precompiled header for `testlib.h`.
